title: Ive Lee's Six-Point Prioritization Method
---

The Ivy Lee method for prioritizing work is as follows:

1. Write down the top 6 things that you have to do today.
2. Start with number 1.
3. Work on it through completion before moving onto the next one.

I first learned about this system while reading / listening to (Lead the Field)[]. It is a very simple yet very powerful way to manage your work. It fits in well with other personal management systems and can be used in conjunction with them.

I don't use this religiously every day, but have found that I can work this into my system as needed. It is always a great way to help me focus. Because of it's simplicity, it easy easy to modify, but use the spirit of the system.

Sometimes, based on my job, I have multiple projects that I need to move forward. I'll write the top 6 that I need to move forward in that day, then make sure that I make progress on each of them in that day.

Other times, I'll slim the list to a smaller number so that I can focus on those minor items.

Many times though, focusing on just one task that needs to be completed before moving onto the next can be very helpful.
