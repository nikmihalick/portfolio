title: an epic strategy for managing development work
---

Epics are my preferred way of managing engineering tasks. They provide a high-level view into the work that has to be completed. They can be prioritized in large chunks of time. Used to build out roadmaps. Identify their important to other items. It provides open-ended tasks that focus on vision and goals. They are easy to move around and compare against each other. These are all good things about epics. How does this help with managing engineering efforts?

One area is flexibility. This isn't a given by default. Epics can be broken down into smaller tasks. This can create a method for creating sub epics, then stories, then tasks. I've been in positions where I have not only defined the epics, but did the work to identify the stories that should fit into the epic. I thought, at the time, that this was helping with flow of the team. When I give them this epic, they know the stories, we can estimate the effort, and off they go. This way I could stack epics, do some pre-work, and have some accurate estimates. That wasn't a good process. I could become a bottleneck at times as multiple teams are waiting for the epics. It also takes ownership away from the individuals. It also meant that I was using using stories to identify the epics, instead of working on the commander's intent for the epic.

So based on that, how does this provide flexibility? Well, first off don't do that :). Instead, focus on identifying the important parts of the epic that is needed for the individuals. Why is it needed? What problem(s) is it solving? What is the expected outcome of the project? Are there deadlines? Who are the customers? How do we get this in front of the customers? Who is all needed to accomplish the epic? If you can identify this, then you can more easily give the epic to the person. For me, I could now spend my time working with the team members, answering questions, removing blockers, coordinating across teams, etc, instead of worry about getting the stories created for the next set of work.

With that felxibility in mind, you can now use these epics to manage the work. Is an epic for a team or an individual? If it's a team, who will lead the effort? Either way, how many epics can a team or person work on at a time? If one is blocked, what is the next epic to work on? 

The epics are also a place for everyone to place their work. As they build out tasks, stories, diagrams, etc, they can place it against the epic. It's often good to have some space for the epic, such as a wiki page, where this information can be stored. It provides an easy way to record information throughout the project. 

From a management standpoint, epics provide a great way to discuss the work being done on a project or product. You don't need to discuss the gritty details with other managers, instead you need to define the work being done now, an estimate on how long it will take, and who is working on it. You also need to be able to show what this new request will affect, which puts epics in a great standpoint. As you track progress, you can better estimate how many epics you can complete in a given sprint, how much work they were, and even, with a fuller retrospective, identify how well the completed epics worked out for the team.

This all sounds great, but much of it is surface fluff. If you are going to go this route, what else is needed? Metrics are still important. As are estimates. You also do need to understand the details, and how to see the details. What is needed to help with this? Here are some ideas for managing this process.

Discuss epics with individuals during their one-on-ones. What epic(s) are they working on? Record when they started. How much time they worked on them since your last meeting. What distracted them away from the epic. Is the estimate still correct? Are any assumptions changing? Are the details getting documented? You don't want this to be a performance metric for the individual. Instead, you want to make it a focus on getting data on the epic that can be used in future discussions about epics.

Estimation strategy using t-shirt sizes or story points or weeks. This should change based on your team size and how you operate, but it a useful way to track the work. This should be an indication over a period of time -- I typically like to indicate what quarter an epic will be completed. From there, I identify a metric, such as a t-shirt size, where I align the size with the expected team effort for completion. L might be multiple members full time, whereas S might be one person part time.

Tracking -- with the estimates in place, you should track the expected completion time -- again I like quarters. Then use your individual tracking along with your estimate to determine the accuracy. When did you want to complete it verse when was it completed. Note, this last part should be based only on when it started because you will often change priorities of the epics that are not in development over time.

What else is needed?
